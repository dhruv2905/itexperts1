        <h2>Instructions:</h2>

        <ol>
            <li><strong>Prepare the Dough:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>In a large mixing bowl, combine gram flour, semolina, turmeric powder, red chili powder,
                        asafoetida, salt, and 2 tablespoons of oil.</li>
                    <li>Gradually add water to form a smooth and soft dough. Ensure that the dough is not too sticky.
                    </li>
                    <li>Cover the dough and let it rest for at least 15-20 minutes.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>

            <li><strong>Divide and Roll:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Divide the dough into small portions and roll each portion into a long, thin strip, resembling a
                        rope. Aim for uniform thickness to ensure even frying.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>

            <li><strong>Shape the Fafda:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Gently press and flatten each rolled strip to form thin, elongated sheets. You can use a rolling
                        pin to achieve the desired thickness.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>

            <li><strong>Heat the Oil:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>In a deep pan or kadhai, heat sufficient oil for deep frying. To check if the oil is ready, drop
                        a small piece of dough into the oil; if it rises to the surface and sizzles, the oil is hot
                        enough.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>

            <li><strong>Fry the Fafda:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Carefully slide the rolled fafda strips into the hot oil, frying a few at a time. Fry until they
                        turn golden brown and crispy. Use a slotted spoon to remove them from the oil and drain excess
                        oil by placing them on absorbent paper.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>

            <li><strong>Prepare the Tempering (Optional):</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>In a separate pan, heat a tablespoon of oil. Add mustard seeds, sesame seeds, asafoetida, and
                        curry leaves. Allow them to splutter and release their aroma. Pour this tempering over the fried
                        fafda for added flavor.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>

            <li><strong>Serve and Enjoy:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Fafda Gathiya can be enjoyed on its own or paired with green chutney, tamarind chutney, or a cup
                        of hot chai. Serve it during festivals, family gatherings, or simply indulge in its crunchy
                        goodness as a snack.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ol>
