                <li><strong>Prepare the Dough:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>In a large mixing bowl, combine gram flour, semolina, turmeric powder, red chili powder,
                            asafoetida, salt, and 2 tablespoons of oil.</li>
                        <li>Gradually add water to form a smooth and soft dough. Ensure that the dough is not too sticky.
                        </li>
                        <li>Cover the dough and let it rest for at least 15-20 minutes.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
    
                <li><strong>Divide and Roll:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Divide the dough into small portions and roll each portion into a long, thin strip, resembling a
                            rope. Aim for uniform thickness to ensure even frying.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
    
                <li><strong>Shape the Fafda:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Gently press and flatten each rolled strip to form thin, elongated sheets. You can use a rolling
                            pin to achieve the desired thickness.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
    
                <li><strong>Heat the Oil:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>In a deep pan or kadhai, heat sufficient oil for deep frying. To check if the oil is ready, drop
                            a small piece of dough into the oil; if it rises to the surface and sizzles, the oil is hot
                            enough.</li>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Carefully slide the rolled fafda strips into the hot oil, frying a few at a time. Fry until they
                            turn golden brown and crispy. Use a slotted spoon to remove them from the oil and drain excess
                            oil by placing them on absorbent paper.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
    
                <li><strong>Prepare the Tempering (Optional):</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>In a separate pan, heat a tablespoon of oil. Add mustard seeds, sesame seeds, asafoetida, and
                            curry leaves. Allow them to splutter and release their aroma. Pour this tempering over the fried
                            fafda for added flavor.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
    
                <li><strong>Serve and Enjoy:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Fafda Gathiya can be enjoyed on its own or paired with green chutney, tamarind chutney, or a cup
                            of hot chai. Serve it during festivals, family gatherings, or simply indulge in its crunchy
